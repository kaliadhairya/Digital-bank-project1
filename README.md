# Digittal-bank-project1
DebitHub was developed as a collaborative project aimed at building a comprehensive mobile application. This digital banking app incorporates nearly all essential features and includes enhancements like dark mode and dual roles for admin and user within the same platform. Administrators are added exclusively through my Firebase project console.
